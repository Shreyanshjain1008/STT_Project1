# STT_Project1
Full-Stack STT App (Next.js/Flask) converts voice to text. Frontend captures audio; Flask backend preprocesses audio (16kHz, 16-bit WAV via pydub), handles CORS, and securely calls the Deepgram API via a Bearer token for real-time transcription. Demonstrates robust full-stack data flow and API integration.
